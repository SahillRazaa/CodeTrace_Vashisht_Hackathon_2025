# CodeTrace: AI-Powered Code Debugger, Optimizer & Dry-Run Visualizer

CodeTrace is an interactive debugging and dry-run visualization tool designed to help developers understand code execution step by step. It goes beyond traditional debugging by integrating gamified bug-fixing challenges and real-life-inspired coding scenarios. The platform allows users to input their code, visualize execution flow, identify logical errors, and improve problem-solving skills through engaging exercises. Whether you're a beginner learning code execution or an experienced developer debugging complex logic, CodeTrace makes the process intuitive and insightful.
## Problem Statement
Debugging and understanding code execution is a critical yet often challenging task for developers. Traditional debugging tools provide breakpoints and step-through execution but lack intuitive visual representation, making it difficult for beginners and even experienced developers to grasp complex logic flows efficiently.

Additionally, many developers struggle with translating real-world problems into code and fixing bugs in an engaging, practical manner. Existing solutions do not emphasize learning through interactive means, leaving a gap between theoretical coding knowledge and real-world debugging experience.

### Challenges Faced by Developers
- **Lack of Visual Debugging:** Most debugging tools focus on line-by-line execution but do not provide a clear, visual representation of the code flow.
- **Steep Learning Curve for Beginners:** Many aspiring developers struggle with understanding how their code runs behind the scenes.
- **Time-Consuming Debugging Process:** Manually tracing errors and fixing bugs can be inefficient and frustrating.
- **Limited Interactive Learning:** Debugging is often learned through trial and error rather than structured, engaging challenges.
- **Gap Between Theory and Practice:** Many developers lack exposure to real-world bug-fixing scenarios that mimic industry challenges.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file for the server side.

`PORT`

`MONGO_URL`

`JWT_SEC`

Also you need to add a Unsplash Access Token Key in the 'RelatedRealLife.jsx' file which is located at '/app/src/pages/service' from the main directory
# Installation & Setup Guide

Follow this step-by-step guide to set up and run the project on your local machine.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS version recommended)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (Frontend build tool)
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) (Database)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download/windows) (For Llama model)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (Version control)
- [Unsplash API Key](https://unsplash.com/developers) (For image generation, optional)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SahillRazaa/CodeTrace_Vashisht_Hackathon_2025.git
cd CodeTrace_Vashisht_Hackathon_2025
```

## Step 2: Install Ollama and Pull Llama Model

Download and install Ollama from: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download/windows) 

Open a terminal and pull the Llama 3.2 model:

```bash
Ollama pull llama3.2
```
Start the Ollama server:

```bash
Ollama serve
```

## Step 3: Set Up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd app
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite-powered frontend on a local server (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Step 4: Set Up the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd ../server
```
Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Setup Nodemon in the package.json

```bash
"start": "nodemon index.js"
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will run on http://localhost:8000 by default.

## Step 5: Configure MongoDB Atlas

Create a MongoDB Atlas account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) 

Set up a new database cluster and obtain your MongoDB connection string

Create a .env file inside the server directory and add:

```bash
MONGO_URL = your_mongodb_connection_string
```
Restart the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 6: Enable Unsplash API 

Sign up at [Unsplash API Key](https://unsplash.com/developers)

Create an application and get an API access key

Add it to your .env file:

Create a .env file inside the server directory and add:

```bash
UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY = your_api_key
```
Restart the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```
